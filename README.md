# Smart-Traffic-Management-System
The Smart Traffic Management System Simulator is a practical project designed to replicate real-world traffic management in a city. It optimizes urban traffic flow using data structures like graphs, heaps, and priority queues. The system focuses on real-time vehicle routing, traffic signal control, congestion management, and emergency handling.
